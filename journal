Student Name: Amanda Windsor
Date started: 11/10/2021

Monday 11/10/21 6:00pm-7:00pm
Work:
Understanding how the program should work:
- Thorough reading of the Assignment 2 Task Sheet
- Took notes on important bits
- Wrote checklist of important things to remember and tick off
  before submitting assignment
Started working on a rough flowchart to get general idea of program
Wrote first draft pseudocode for main program
Wrote code for import random module, welcome message, instructions.
Challenges: Got a bit caught up overthinking the functions and had to wind myself back

Tuesday 12/10/21 10:00am-1:00pm with a few breaks
Work:
Wrote code for menu
Went ahead and wrote it and then double checked with the Programming Guide.
Looks good.
Started working on simulate_day function and add_animal function.
Did testing of everything I've done so far
Challenges:
Double check how to create list for the animals and the append() function.
Got a bit stuck on how to delete random animal from list. Fine with del but unsure how to make it a random animal
Re-read the lists and tuples chapter in textbook and re-watched lecture videos.

Thursday 14/10/21 11:00-12:30
Work:
Worked on calculating amount of income according to formula
wrote code for generate random number for luck and display lucky number of the day.
Did loose psuedocode for add_animal function, started on code.
    wrote code for error checking animal name and checking that the new animal didn't already exist in animal_list.
    wrote code for calculating cost of new animal.
    Did testing of everything I've done so far
Challenges:
Needed to double check how to calculate cost of new animal, had to refresh my memory through the lecture material
and practicals

Saturday 16/10/21
Wrote pseudocode and code for add_animal function with error check and
slicing the substring to display the animal names correct to
desired output
Formatting animal names to display with uppercase first letter
and comma at the end of each animal name
Did testing of everything I've done so far
Challenges: Had the right idea with the formatting but had to try a couple of times to get it exactly how
I wanted it

Sunday 17/10/21 2:00pm-3:00pm
Work
Worked on formatting for display_animals function and perfecting it
Did testing of everything I've done so far
No issues... at this stage

Tuesday 19/10/21 10:00-12:00
Work:
Working on simulate_day function, getting the calculation part working
Challenges:
I need to work out how to convert to int as i am converting it but
it is not giving the correct output, the same as the examples
e.g Today's lucky number is 52.
Antelope earned 8, Fox earned 3, Zebra earned 5,
After 1 day, you have 3 animals and your total income is 7.
something is wrong with the maths but i'm going to move on and come back to it

Wednesday 20/10/21 7:00-8:00
Work:
Testing everything.
Challenges:
Silly mistake. Forgot to put menu and user choice at bottom of main menu
so I had accidentally made a never ending loop. woops. I definitely won't make that mistake again.
had some trouble with simulate_lucky_day returning the value that it was calculating
but realised during lecture that I hadn't assigned the function
to a variable. Lesson learnt

Thursday 21/10/21 12:00-2:00
Work:
Fix add new animal loop goes to infinite and says you already have dog when i dont already have dog.
does a day get added when you add an animal?
Got converting to int working after revising material.
Got the 'Wait' calculations working, i had my for loop in the function but changed it to be in main and it started working

Friday 22/10/21
running tests
checking off what's working a little bits to fix up
intro and main menu - working
display - working
adding an animal you can't afford - working
started doing finishing touches, worked on pseudocode to match any changes I had made

Sunday 24/10/21 12:00-1:00
Testing and perfecting, output is good, I'm happy.
